Github is a source control system.

If you're writing a piece of code,
1. You might make changes to it that turn out to be sad. (We've all faced this)
2. You might be working in a team and someone else might be coding on the same thing with you.

Github solves issues like these. It versions the codes and gives you the ability to control the kind of changes that are to be made to the code

Repository is like a project.
